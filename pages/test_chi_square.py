One day, while strolling through a local farmer's market, Dave came across three different types of tomato plants: red, yellow, and green. Excited by the possibilities, he decided to grow these tomatoes in his garden and see how they would thrive."),
        html.P("Dave divided his garden into two sections, labelling them 'Section A' and 'Section B.' In Section A, he used traditional soil, and in Section B, he experimented with a new nutrient-rich soil mix. With great care, Dave planted an equal number of tomato plants from each colour group in both sections."),
        html.P("As the weeks went by, Dave diligently watered and tended to his tomato plants, eagerly awaiting the day they would bear fruit. Finally, the moment arrived. Dave marvelled at the sight of his garden bursting with vibrant red, yellow, and green tomatoes. But he began to wonder if the type of soil had influenced the distribution of tomato colours across the sections."),
        html.P("Curiosity getting the better of him, Dave decided to investigate further. He turned to the power of statistics to help him uncover any potential associations. With a little research, he discovered a statistical test called the chi-square test, which could determine whether there was a significant relationship between two categorical variables."),
        html.P("Armed with newfound knowledge, Dave set out to conduct the chi-square test on his tomato data. He started by counting the number of red, yellow, and green tomatoes in each section. In Section A, he found 30 red, 20 yellow, and 10 green tomatoes. In Section B, the counts were 25 red, 15 yellow, and 20 green tomatoes."),
        html.P("Dave began constructing a contingency table, using the columns to represent the tomato colours (red, yellow, and green) and the rows to represent the sections (X and Y). He filled in the observed values accordingly."),
        html.P("To proceed with the chi-square test, Dave needed to calculate the expected values for each cell in the contingency table. The expected values represent what he would expect to see if there were no relationship between the type of soil and tomato colour. Utilizing the formula:"),

        html.P("Dave calculated the expected values and filled them into the contingency table. Now, it was time to compute the chi-square test statistic."),
        html.P("Applying the chi-square formula, Dave found that the test statistic was 4.5. The next step was to compare this value with the critical value from a chi-square distribution table. The critical value is determined based on the degrees of freedom, which depend on the dimensions of the contingency table."),
        html.P("After examining the table, Dave concluded that 4.5 was less than the critical value. This indicated that there was not a significant association between the type of soil and tomato colour."),
        html.P("Although Dave didn't find a significant relationship, he was not disheartened. He realized that the chi-square test had provided valuable insights into the distribution of tomato colours across the two sections of his garden. It had helped him analyze the data and make informed conclusions."),
