        html.P("Dave envisioned his coin collection as a list of treasures, each with a distinct value. To better understand DCG, he decided to delve into its inner workings. First, he selected his top 10 rare coins and assigned each a relevance score based on historical significance, condition, and personal preference."),
        html.P("As Dave delved into DCG, he learned that it was a measure designed to evaluate the quality of a ranked list. It factored in both the relevance of each item and its position in the list. The formula for DCG involved summing up the relevance scores, but with a twist â€“ the scores were discounted based on their position."),
        html.P("Dave imagined it like this: the further down the list a coin was, the less impact its relevance would have on the overall DCG. It was as if the treasures at the top of the list were more influential in determining the overall quality."),
        html.P("However, as Dave continued his exploration, he encountered a dilemma. What if he compared two lists of different lengths? The regular DCG wouldn't be fair in this scenario, as longer lists inherently had higher scores."),
        html.P("This is where Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) stepped in as the hero of fairness. Dave learned that NDCG is calculated by dividing the regular DCG by the ideal DCG, which represented the perfect ranking."),
        html.P("Dave realized that calculating the ideal DCG involved ranking his treasures based on their relevance scores and then summing up their discounted values. This became the benchmark against which the regular DCG was normalized, ensuring a fair comparison between lists of different lengths."),
        html.P("With this newfound understanding, Dave went home excited to reorganize his coin collection using NDCG. He carefully considered the rarity of each coin, its quality, and its age. As he made these changes, he realized that NDCG was not only applicable to his hobby but also to various scenarios where ranking and order mattered."),
